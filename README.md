# single_voxel_mrs_b0_shimming
This repo includes a jupyter notebook to analyze and compare MRS spectra acquired using different B0 shim optimization approaches. 

The notebook is designed to reproduce the processing pipeline and visualize the results for the paper titled "On the Impact of B0 Shimming Algorithms on Single Voxel Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy," authored by Behrouz Vejdani Afkham and Eva Alonso-Ortiz.

The data for this paper is available online on OSF (https://osf.io/s3gwv/) and will be downloaded in the notebook to reproduce the results.
